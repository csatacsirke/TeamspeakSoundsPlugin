# Soundplayer plugin for TeamSpeak3

Provides a way to quickly choose a sound from your library, even if you have many items.
In my case, this is 700+ at the time of writing.
It has an overlay, that works in-game (requires Windows 10), and its fully controlled with
keyboard. You don't have to alt-tab out of your full screen app.

Supports any sound file, that Windows Media Player supports, usually `.wav`, or `.mp3`.

It can connect to the Twitch channel points API, if you want to allow others, to use 
the soundplayer functionality as a channel point reward.

It has it's quirks and limitations, but it gets the job done.
